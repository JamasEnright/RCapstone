[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JamasEnright/RCapstone.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JamasEnright/RCapstone)


This is the Earthquake visualisation package, using earthquake data from the U.S. National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Significant Earthquake Database. This dataset contains information about 5,933 earthquakes over an approximately 4,000 year time span.

This is available from [the NOAA data website](https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/nndc/struts/form?t=101650&s=1&d=1).

Currently using this package requires using 'install_github' tool to install.

The package contains a number of functions to visualise the earthquake data.

See the vignette "Earthquake Visualisation" for a demonstration on how to use the package.
